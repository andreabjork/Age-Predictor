# Age-Predictor
Project for Machine Learning Fall 2016 at ETHZ.

> Features

This folder should include py scripts that load the images, create features and then dumps the data (the features)
to a file with the same name. This is so we only have to create the features once, not each time.

> Model

This folder should include py scripts that loads in the previously created features, creates a model from them, and dumps the model to a file using joblib of scikit learn package.

> Submission Scripts

This folder should include the actual scripts that apply the previously created models on the test data and puts the predicted values in a CSV to be submitted to Kaggle
