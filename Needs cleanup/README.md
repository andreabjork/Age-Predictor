> Features

This folder should include py scripts that load the images, create features and then dumps the data (the features)
to a file with the same name. This is so we only have to create the features once, not each time.

> Model

This folder should include py scripts that loads in the previously created features, creates a model from them, and dumps the model to a file using joblib of scikit learn package.
